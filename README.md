# 🤖 LangGraph Multi-Agent Swarm 

A Python library for creating swarm-style multi-agent systems using [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph). A swarm is a type of [multi-agent](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/multi_agent) architecture where agents dynamically hand off control to one another based on their specializations. The system remembers which agent was last active, ensuring that on subsequent interactions, the conversation resumes with that agent.

## Features

- 🤖 **Multi-agent collaboration** - Enable specialized agents to work together and hand off context to each other
- 🛠️ **Customizable handoff tools** - Built-in tools for communication between agents

This library is built on top of [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph), a powerful framework for building agent applications, and comes with out-of-box support for [streaming](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/#streaming), [short-term and long-term memory](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/memory/) and [human-in-the-loop](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/human_in_the_loop/)

## Installation

```bash
pip install langgraph-swarm
```

## Quickstart

```bash
pip install langgraph-swarm langchain-openai

export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
```

```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import InMemorySaver
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent
from langgraph_swarm import create_handoff_tool, create_swarm

model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o")

def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Add two numbers"""
    return a + b

alice = create_react_agent(
    model,
    [add, create_handoff_tool(agent_name="Bob")],
    prompt="You are Alice, an addition expert.",
    name="Alice",
)

bob = create_react_agent(
    model,
    [create_handoff_tool(agent_name="Alice", description="Transfer to Alice, she can help with math")],
    prompt="You are Bob, you speak like a pirate.",
    name="Bob",
)

checkpointer = InMemorySaver()
app = create_swarm(
    [alice, bob],
    default_active_agent="Alice"
).compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)

config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}}
turn_1 = app.invoke(
    {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "i'd like to speak to Bob"}]},
    config,
)
print(turn_1)
turn_2 = app.invoke(
    {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "what's 5 + 7?"}]},
    config,
)
print(turn_2)
```

## Memory

You can add [short-term](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/persistence/) and [long-term](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/cross-thread-persistence/) [memory](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/memory/) to your swarm multi-agent system. Since `create_swarm()` returns an instance of `StateGraph` that needs to be compiled before use, you can directly pass a [checkpointer](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/checkpoints/#langgraph.checkpoint.base.BaseCheckpointSaver) or a [store](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/store/#langgraph.store.base.BaseStore) instance to the `.compile()` method:

```python
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import InMemorySaver
from langgraph.store.memory import InMemoryStore

checkpointer = InMemorySaver()
store = InMemoryStore()

model = ...
alice = ...
bob = ...

workflow = create_swarm(
    [alice, bob],
    default_active_agent="Alice"
)

# Compile with checkpointer/store
app = workflow.compile(
    checkpointer=checkpointer,
    store=store
)
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Adding [short-term memory](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/persistence/) is crucial for maintaining conversation state across multiple interactions. Without it, the swarm would "forget" which agent was last active and lose the conversation history. Make sure to always compile the swarm with a checkpointer; e.g., `workflow.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)` if you plan to use it in multi-turn conversations.
